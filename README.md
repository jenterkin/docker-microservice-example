# Container Workshop Project
This project exists for the purpose of showing how Docker works. The application here, while dumb, is a very simple webapp with a web server, database, api backend, and frontend all running in separate containers. Soon this repo will be comprised of branches with intermediate steps from a monolith to a microservice web application.

# Getting started
```
docker-compose up
```
